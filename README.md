# Hypothesis_Testing
This is a repository for a very beginner users of Python/Jupyter notebook.

In this repository i will load some simple python scripts to perform all the possible test of hypothesis you can find in https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/

In order to run them, please just copy and paste the code in "CallYourStat.py" in you notebook, select the test you want yo use and  and run it from there. 

Alternatively (if yo uhave some confidence with python) feel free to simply run the tests directly without calling it from a notebook.

Before doing so, please make sure you install the libraries listed in requirements.txt
